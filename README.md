# ScrollScape – a landscape revealed by scrolling

A visually engaging **scroll-driven image gallery** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (GSAP + Lenis)**.  
As you scroll, images animate into view with scaling, 3D perspective, and smooth transitions.  
The sequence ends with a **final full-screen image** and fading text animations for intro and outro headers.

## 📂 How It Works
1. Images are initially placed off-screen with 3D transforms.  
2. On scroll, each image animates into position using **GSAP interpolation**.  
3. Text headers fade in/out word-by-word for added visual effect.  
4. A final image scales up to fullscreen, marking the end of the animation.
